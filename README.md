This repository contains scripts and files to read,
plot and process data from *DataTaker* file(s).
Two modules are provided:
`explore.py`, with useful functions for processing and visualizing data,
and `xpint.py`, that implements a subclass of `UnitRegistry`
from the [`pint`](https://pint.readthedocs.io) package,
to manage units and plot labelling.

## The `explore` module
The functions `read`, `get` and `plot` can be used respectively to read,
extract and plot the data from a *DataTaker* file.
All actions are also combined in one unique function called `explore`,
which is more concise but has a little less flexibility.
Each function from the `explore` module is briefly described at the end, but more information can be found
in their respective documentationâ€”available through the `help` function.

## The `xpint` module
`xpint` (extended pint) provides an extension of `pint`'s `UnitRegistry`
class that is used to define a new `Quantity` class,
in order to provide a few more attributes.
More details and examples can be found in the documentation,
available using
```python
import xpint
help(xpint.UnitRegistry().Quantity)
```

### Functions of the `explore` module
| Function names  | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| `explore`       | Plot and/or read the data from a file. This is basically a combination of the functions `read`, `get` and `plot`. |
| `read`          | Read the data from the file into a DataFrame. |
| `get`           | Extract specific variables from a DataFrame into `Quantity` objects. |
| `plot`          | (Sub)plot one or several `Quantity` objects. |
| `thermo_cal` 		| Compute heat transfer from flow rate, pressures and temperatures. |
| `plot_files`    | Plot a quantity for several files to allow comparison. |
